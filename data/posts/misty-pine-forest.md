&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_You, Masha and I_ were walking in the misty pine
forest, where trees had crystal ice trunks and snowy branches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground was covered with a thin layer of snow, the
moss was blue. It was gently bright despite the sun slowly hiding behind the
horizon, and the mist was so milky and dense. The air was filled with fresh
mixture of morning frost, the smell of pine trees and moss. Instead of spooky
cat-like sounds, pine trees were playing crystal melodies as if they were
wearing little bells on their crowns. And that forest felt like home - cozy and
safe. No other people we could meet there, only forestâ€™s habitats, and even the
wildest animals were friendly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peaceful journey full of wonders three of us have had
last night.
