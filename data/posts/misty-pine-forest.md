&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_You, Masha and I_ were walking in the misty pine
forest, where trees had crystal ice trunks and snowy branches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground wasnâ€™t covered with snow, the moss was blue.
It was light enough despite the sun slowly hiding behind the horizon, and the
mist was so milky and dense. Instead of spooky cat-like sounds, pine trees were
playing crystal melodies like little bells. And that forest felt like home -
safe and cozy. No other people we could meet there, only forestâ€™s habitats, and
even the wildest animals were friendly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peaceful journey full of wonders three of us have had
last night.
